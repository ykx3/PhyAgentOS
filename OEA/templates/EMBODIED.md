# Robot Embodiment Declaration

This file describes the physical capabilities and constraints of the connected robot.
The Critic Agent reads this file to validate whether proposed actions are safe and feasible.

## Identity

- **Name**: OEA Desktop Pet
- **Type**: Desktop-level virtual pet (simulation mode)

## Degrees of Freedom

| Joint | Range | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Head Pan | -90° to +90° | Horizontal head rotation |
| Head Tilt | -45° to +45° | Vertical head rotation |

## Supported Actions

| Action | Parameters | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `nod_head` | — | Nod head up and down |
| `shake_head` | — | Shake head left and right |
| `point_to` | `target: string` | Point toward a named object in the scene |
| `move_to` | `x, y, z: float` | Move to a 3D coordinate |
| `pick_up` | `target: string` | Pick up a named object |
| `put_down` | `target: string, location: string` | Put an object down at a location |
| `push` | `target: string, direction: string` | Push an object in a direction |

## Physical Constraints

- **Workspace bounds**: x ∈ [-50, 50], y ∈ [-50, 50], z ∈ [0, 30] (centimetres)
- **Max payload**: 50 g
- **Max reach**: 15 cm from base
- **Collision policy**: Stop immediately on contact force > 2 N

## Connection

- **Transport**: local simulation
- **Host**: n/a
- **Port**: n/a
- **User**: n/a
- **Auth**: n/a
- **Reconnect Policy**: auto
- **Health Check**: driver-defined heartbeat

## Navigation & Multi-Agent Protocol

- **Environment schema**: `ENVIRONMENT.md` should use `oea.environment.v1` when possible.
- **Per-robot state isolation**: each robot writes only its own key in `robots.<robot_id>`.
- **Connection channel**: `robots.<robot_id>.connection_state` is reserved for runtime connection health.
- **Pose channel**: `robots.<robot_id>.robot_pose` is reserved for localization state.
- **Navigation channel**: `robots.<robot_id>.nav_state` is reserved for runtime nav/task state.
- **Scene graph node fields**: semantic navigation expects `id`, `class`, `center`, `size`, and may use `frame`, `track_id`, `last_seen_at`.
- **Safety distance**: approach distance to obstacles and target objects should be >= 0.5 m unless task requires closer contact.
- **Relocalization support**: if enabled by the active driver, `nav_state` may expose relocalization status and confidence.
- **ROS2 bridge support**: navigation-capable embodiments should declare whether they expose `/cmd_vel`, `/navigate_to_pose`, and `/initialpose`.
