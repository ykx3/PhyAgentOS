🐈 **OpenEmbodiedAgent (OEA)** is an open-source embodied AI framework dedicated to lowering the barrier to entry for robotics. It abandons the dangerous black-box model of "LLMs directly controlling hardware" and pioneers the **"State-as-a-File (Everything is Markdown)"** protocol matrix. Through a **Dual-Track Multi-Agent System** (Software Brain Track A + Hardware HAL Track B), it achieves safe, interpretable, and evolvable robot control.

⚡️ The current version **v0.0.2 (OEA Pioneer Edition)** is built on the ultra-lightweight `nanobot` architecture, aiming to quickly validate OEA's core protocols and workflows through a desktop-level virtual pet and simulation environment.

## 📢 News

- **2026-03-13** 🚀 Released **v0.0.1** — OEA Pioneer Edition released, establishing the core "Everything is Markdown" protocol and validating the software-hardware decoupling and multi-agent validation flow based on a simulation environment.

## Key Features of OEA:

🪶 **Everything is Markdown**: Software and hardware communicate by reading and writing local Markdown files (e.g., `ENVIRONMENT.md`, `ACTION.md`), achieving complete decoupling and extreme transparency.

🧠 **Dual-Track Multi-Agent System**:
- **Track A (Brain)**: Includes Planner and Critic mechanisms. The LLM does not issue commands directly; they must pass the Critic's validation against physical limits (`EMBODIED.md`) before being written to disk.
- **Track B (HAL)**: An independent hardware watchdog (`hal_watchdog.py`) listens for commands and executes them.

🛡️ **Anti-Shitstorm Mechanism**: Strict action validation and a `LESSONS.md` experience repository prevent Agent workflows from spiraling out of control.

🎮 **Simulation Loop**: Built-in lightweight simulation support allows validation of the entire pipeline from natural language commands to physical state changes without real hardware.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The core of OEA is a local Workspace, where software and hardware act as independent daemon processes reading and writing files:

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/OpenEmbodiedAgent.git
cd OpenEmbodiedAgent
pip install -e .
# Install simulation dependencies (e.g., watchdog)
pip install pybullet watchdog
```

### 2. Initialize Workspace

```bash
OEA onboard
```
This will generate the core Markdown protocol files (`EMBODIED.md`, `ENVIRONMENT.md`, etc.) under `~/.OEA/workspace/`.

### 3. Start the System

You need to open two terminals:

**Terminal 1: Start Hardware Watchdog & Simulation (Track B)**
```bash
python hal/hal_watchdog.py
```

**Terminal 2: Start Brain Agent (Track A)**
```bash
OEA agent
```

### 4. Interaction Example

In the `OEA agent` CLI, type:
> "Look at what's on the table, then push that apple onto the floor."

You will see the action executed in the simulation logs in Terminal 1, and receive a completion confirmation from the Agent in Terminal 2.
